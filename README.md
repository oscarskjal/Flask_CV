This is my computer vision Flask backend to my Vue.js application about Arcada!
The Frontend app in question: https://github.com/oscarskjal/cv_arcada


To run this backend, simply do the following:

1. Clone the repository using git clone <thisurl>

2. Open the repo

3. Open a new terminal and activate the virtual environment by typing: venv\Scripts\Activate
  
4. type pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Lastly type in the terminal: python app.py

IF this does not work do the following in the terminal:

1. python -m venv venv

2. venv\Scripts\Activate

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. python app.py
